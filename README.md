# Drag Fish
A fish who likes to drag race
A game by Jake Nurkin & Jory Fulmer:

Game Intent:
The intent of this game was to create a simplified infinite runner style game (reminicent of games like Subway Surfer), wherein players take control of a fish in a dragster.

Narrative Structure:
Since Jimbo was a young fish, he always dreamed of being a professional drag racer. He read all the books he could find, and watched every race broadcast that would come on the TV. He was bullied for his interests, but that never deterred him. So when he got a bit older, He saved up enough cash, and studied hard to make his dreams come true. He bought and restored an old dragster, and tuned it up to perfection, and now… it's time to test drive it!!!

Mechanics:
The game is simmilar to Dragster on the Atari 2600, mixed with Subway Surfers. The game consists of Jimbo testing out his Dragster on the ocean floor. For every rock and obsticle you pass, your score goes up, and for every rock you hit, kiss a point goodbye!

Aesthetics: 
The aesthetics are very simplistic, using a simple artstyle and bright colors. 

Asset Attributions:
All assets used in this game were drawn by Jake Nurkin.

Contributions (Jory):
Throughout my time working on the project, I encountered a lot of issues that impede our progress. All of these issues had to do with my personal hardware. Throughout the process of making this unity project come to life, my personal desktop had to go and fail on me, so I instead had to work on my macbook. This happened to create many more problems, as working on my macbook led to me experiencing a large amount of crashes, and compilation issues that further served to impede progress. When my computer was not crashing, and I was able to work, I was able to create the github for the project, and create and contribute to some of the  many scripts in our game. Most of my work was saved to compliment the excellent progress of my partner, as he worked to be the MVP of this group project. I’m embarrassed that my tech issues served to take us off course, however I’m happy to have been a part of this group, and I am proud of the work that we have done.

Contributions (Jake):
My contributions included drawing the assets, configuring player movement, and the spawning and movement of obstacles. I found joy in finally getting something together and watching the fruits of my labor come to life. The greatest struggle to our team was not only just Jory's computer failing but our team figuring out how to get rocks to be destroyed after going off-screen and awarding the player with a point. I learned that Unity can be extremely finicky to work with, especially if you don't quite know what you're doing.
